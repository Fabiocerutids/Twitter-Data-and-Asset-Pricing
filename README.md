# Twitter-Data-and-Asset-Pricing
The repository contains an analysis of tweets with the goal of predicting sentiment and evaluating whether tweets sentiment could be a new factor in asset pricing.
In particular, different tasks have been carried out:

1) Data manipulation and descriptive statistics
2) Data cleaning and visualization
3) Comparing the predictive performance of a suite of models on the sentiment of the various tweets
4) Employing BERT and FinBERT for sentiment analysis 
5) Measuring media attention across different firms and understanding whether a meaningful relationship between attention and returns is present
6) Scraping web data about other stocks and exploring the media-return relationship
7) Testing the role of the descriptiveness of the tweet as a potential new factor
